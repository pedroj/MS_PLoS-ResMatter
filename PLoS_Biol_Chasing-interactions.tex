Basic research on Biodiversity has concentrated on the study of species, naming new species, studying distribution patterns, and analyzing their evolutionary relationships. Yet Biodiversity is more than a collection of individual species; it is the combination of biological entities and processes that supports the Earth system. Understanding Biodiversity requires its cataloguing, but also assessing the ways species interact with other species and provide a functional support for the Tree of Life. Ecological interactions may be lost well before the species interacting go extinct, so that their ecological functions disappear. Here I address the challenges in studying the functional aspects of species interactions and how basic research is helping us to address the current fast-paced extinction of species due to human activities.

\section*{Author Summary}
Biodiversity, all the different forms of life on Earth, is supported by ecological interactions among species. No single species on Earth lives without interacting with other species. Recent attempts to address the fast-paced loss of biodiversity are being supported by basic research stemming on its inventory (cataloguing species) but also in understanding how species are intertwined within complex webs of ecological interactions that support functional ecosystems.\\

%\subsection*{Introduction}

Suppose you want to build the LEGO\circledR \textit{Triceratops Trapper} model (it is model no. 5885-1). It has 256 pieces, corresponding to 74 distinct parts. It's a relatively simple artifact; yet impossible to build by assembling these 256 pieces at random. To get the fully functional Triceratops Trapper we need to know not only the inventory of its parts: we also need to know how the different pieces are connected together. We'll have a functional Triceratops Trapper if and only if we assemble the model connecting its component pieces the right way. Species in ecosystems are not connected (linked) by random interactions; there are regularities independent on the type of ecosystem and even on the type of ecological interaction. This Web of Life \cite{Thompson:2009} defines the wireframe that supports Biodiversity, and ecological interactions provide essential services and functionality for its persistence. Interactions might be lost (extinct) even well before the species. For instance, the "empty forest syndrome" \cite{Redford:1992} describes situations where animals and plants may persist in disturbed areas (e.g,, a tropical forest fragment) yet with so much reduced abundances that their functional ecological role is lost. Interaction extinction may result in collapse of important ecological functions such as pollination and seed dispersal, crucial for forest regeneration and ecosystem persistence. These losses of interactions cause unprecedented changes in cascade in natural communities, implying losses of ecological functions that are crucial for ecosystem persistence. For example, just imagine the myriad consequences of extinctions of pollinators and frugivore seed dispersers for ecosystems like tropical rainforests, where more than 90\% of the woody plant species need their interactions to support their life cycles. 

Ecological interactions are the wireframe of biodiversity. No single species on Earth lives without interacting with other species. Thus, Biodiversity is more than just species: interactions among them are the architecture that supports ecosystems. It’s the Web of Life. Exploring and inventorying Biodiversity represents a fundamental challenge for basic research in ecology and conservation biology. This basic knowledge is urgently required to properly diagnose the status of Biodiversity conservation and develop early warning signals for situations of collapse.

\subsection*{Diversity: of species and their interactions}

The Web of Life assembles species that interact with each other in a variety of ways, conforming complex interaction networks. A myriad of interaction modes exists in nature and illustrates with fascinating details the complexity of natural histories of partner species. Forms of interaction include predation, competition, commensalism, amensalism, mutualism, symbiosis, parasitism and in all cases involve reciprocal effects for the interacting species. Recent basic research on the topology and structure of these networks has revealed universal patterns that ultimately affect their stability and resilience, yet we are far from fully documenting all the types of interaction modes that exist even in simple ecosystems. 

Just in the same way we sample individuals of free living species to estimate the diversity in a particular area or ecosystem, we can sample interactions. In this way we can assess the full complexity of ecosystem structure.
